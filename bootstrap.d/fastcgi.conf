# WARNING: this is a kludge:
## The User/Group for httpd need to be set before we can load mod_fastcgi,
## but /etc/httpd/conf.d/fastcgi.conf on RHEL gets loaded before
## /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf, so we need to set them here :(
## mod_fcgid does not have this bug,
## but it does not handle child PHP processes appropriately per
## http://serverfault.com/questions/303535/a-single-php-fastcgi-process-blocks-all-other-php-requests/305093#305093

  # FastCGI applications under mod_fastcgi are defined as one of three types: static, dynamic, or external. They're configured using the FastCgiServer, FastCgiConfig, and FastCgiExternalServer directives respectively.
  # Since we are using php-fpm, Php has its own process manager, so we set FastCgiExternalServer
  # SELinux somehow prevented to use sockets, so we are using TCP/IP. To do so one must run:
  # setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on
  #FastCgiExternalServer /var/www/cgi-bin/php5-fcgi -socket /var/run/php-fpm/php5-fpm.sock -pass-header Authorization -user apache -group apache
  FastCgiExternalServer /var/www/cgi-bin/php5-fcgi -host 127.0.0.1:9000 -pass-header Authorization
